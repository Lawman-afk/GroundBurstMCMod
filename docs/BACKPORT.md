# Ground Burst for Minecraft 1.21.1 (the backport)

The mod is made on Minecraft 26.3 (branch `main`). This branch, `1.21.1`, carries it back to Minecraft 1.21.1 on
NeoForge 21.1 for players still on that version. It is not kept in step with every change: it is brought up to `main`
every once in a while, as a whole.

- **Last brought up to:** `main` at `c7c644b6` (2026-11-03: version 0.6.0 and the finished artillery).
- **Toolchain:** Minecraft 1.21.1, NeoForge 21.1.265, Java 21, GeckoLib 4.9.3, JEI 19.70 (optional).
- **Test instance:** a separate 1.21.1 CurseForge instance, named by `deploy_instance_dir_1_21_1` in your own
  `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` (never `deploy_instance_dir`, which is main's 26.3 instance).

## How it is made

Most of the difference between 26.3 and 1.21.1 is mechanical: names that changed (`Identifier` was `ResourceLocation`,
`GuiGraphicsExtractor` was `GuiGraphics`), methods that moved, a different signature on an overridden method. So the
code is not ported by hand file by file. `tools/backport/port.py` turns main's sources into this branch's:

1. **Rules**: ordered text substitutions over the Java sources (renamed classes and methods, changed signatures of
   overridden methods, imports).
2. **Compatibility classes** in `dev.groundburst.port`: small stand-ins with main's API over 1.21.1's (a `ValueOutput`
   over a `CompoundTag`, for example), so the code that uses them needs no change at all. They exist only on this
   branch.
3. **Resource moves**: GeckoLib 4 reads `geo/` and `animations/` (GeckoLib 5 reads `geckolib/models/` and
   `geckolib/animations/`); recipe ingredients are objects in 1.21.1 (`{"item": ...}`), not strings.
4. **Hand edits**, where no rule is worth writing (the client's rendering, which 26.x rebuilt round render states and
   submit nodes). The files edited by hand are listed in `tools/backport/manual.txt`.

## Bringing it up to main

Because the port of a file is repeatable, a newer `main` comes in as a three-way merge of ported text: for each file
`main` changed since the last sync, the old and new versions are both run through `port.py`; a file nobody edited by
hand here is replaced outright, and one that was edited gets main's change merged into it (`git merge-file`), so only
where a hand edit and main's change touch the same lines is there anything to resolve. Then build, run the GameTests,
fix what broke, and update the line above.
